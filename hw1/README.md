Hello All,

For this homework, I tried very hard to implement IBM model 1, which failed horribly at first because I forgot to lower the uppercase letters. After that one single change enlighted by the awesome TA Ling, I managed to pull up the AER from 0.69 till 0.49 with the same model python code.

Then I tried various threshhold/tricks for decoding, and I managed to have 0.4061.
