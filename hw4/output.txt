six hundred and seventy - two school assistant coordinator , working with parents and other employees who were among the most low - wage workers in the city , have lost their place on october 7 , as a result of that union leaders called the political reaction to their refusal to give access to medical city funds , managed workers ' groups , to close a hole in the budget last spring .
at a hearing in the city council last month , schools chancellor dennis m. уолкотт said that layoffs were part of the budget , which they signed in june .

представитель люгера said on monday that he has not yet seen the latest bill .
this measure , proposed a member of the u.s. house of representatives , republican bob гудлатом ( virginia ) , will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or about anything else that will be on the plenary vote of congress this session .

president felipe calderon 's sister , seems to have not made its bid for the governor 's seat michoacan state elections during the fierce , and she said on monday that the traffickers have helped sway the race in favor of one of her opponents .
" interference by organized crime during the entire election process and particularly alarming , not only for michoacan , but yesterday and for the whole country , " said luisa maria calderon радиоинтервью in the next day , sunday after the vote .
pri ruled mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000 .
calderon , national action party candidate , or ipa , headed by her brother , refused to acknowledge вальехо winner .
ауреолес also refused to recognize the preliminary results .
long dominated drug cartels in michoacan , specialize in cannabis , heroin and метамфетаминах .
for the pri , however , no matter how badly looked elections in michoacan , victory will give momentum behind the party .
раджат naga , managing director of the adb 's office in manila , said the two most big emerging economies must " do everything that can " to accelerate the recovery in the currency bloc with the international monetary fund or direct bilateral agreements .
" asia can be protected to some extent , but it cannot be invulnerable . "
european monetary union was badly undermined by the european debt crisis in recent months .
unfolding in europe 's debt crisis has spawned fears that he can lead the global economy into recession again , and led to calls for the leading emerging economies gather together to help the eurozone find a solution . "
anand sharma , india 's trade minister , said that " india will do everything that can " to help the eurozone , as its own economy is now declining exports and reducing foreign capital inflows .
" we have ambitious goals , and we must maintain a high level of growth . "
others argue that there is no sense for emerging economies like india to help wealthy europeans , when they face their own deep economic problems .
" at some point , they know that greeks are retiring in 50 years and go on holidays to the sea , and it will not be perceived well , " he said .

defense secretary leon panetta tempers in congress on monday , warning that expected automatic budget cuts will undermine national security and generate financial chain reaction from pentagon corridors to fields of battle in afghanistan on the line and the civil assembly .
" the consequences of these reductions would be devastating for the ministry , " panetta said in a letter to senators республиканцу республиканке john mccain , arizona and lindsey graham of south carolina .
" so , make such a strong reduction , the majority of our construction projects on кораблестроению and unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or buildings -- and do serious damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote senators .
" these changes undermine trust , who supports our army and will seriously damage боеготовности . "
" although foreign military financing in emergency operations does not directly affected секвестром , military achievements be severely affected by serious breakdown in the main budgets , " warned panetta .
" staff will be reduced that lead to опозданиям staffer with military suppliers , and legal and political support will be disrupted . "
" the consequence of sequestration in the department of defense will be rapid decline in the united states as world 's leading military powers . "
" this is not an option , with which we live , and this is not an option , which we need to impose ourselves . "
whether panetta letter or recent warnings senators will lead to budget compromise or inflame calls for release from the pentagon cuts , we 'll see later .
at a press conference last week , defense minister painted a gloomy picture of what might follow next -- troops with shell , but without the kernel .
" this paper tiger , the army to barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission , " panetta said in his introductory remarks in the pentagon .
and panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects may encounter obstacles , including those which passed the tests , and some only in the early stages of planning .
halting further development and testing the f 35 can save $ 80 billion over 10 years , but his supporters say is a vital next step to improve and to counter potential threats from china and other opponents .
a cursory glance at recent headlines , shows how serious and повсеместны deception and lies in everyday life .
administration at the university of pennsylvania was charged in лжесвидетельствовании , because they allegedly hid the schlensker retired football coach raped boys .
former presidential candidate john edwards was indicted in financial fraud during the campaign , involving укрывательством extramarital affairs .
stories of fraud on exams at school and college - standard deal .
mentors who should teach the opposite , send a message that the lies and fraud are acceptable .
in one day , studies show that you can lie from 10 to 200 times .
another study showed that strangers солгали three times for the first 10 minutes to get acquainted with each other .
in contrast to the games room , like , say , charades , where you exclaim , " caught ! " to detect lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , especially on psychology and physiology .
not worth of hard to conclude that liars do notice and it is difficult to expose .
i spent a few years , examining scientific discoveries in the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about lie detection , and it is clear that modern skill , which is easy to learn and that helps in meaningful in our complex world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviewing , negotiating or management .
we know from research that extroverts than introverts lied more frequently , that men are more lie about yourself , whereas women -- about the other , usually to protect someone 's feelings that married people lied to its partners , less than unmarried ( but the lie , that they say , often наглая ) .
watch позой , laughter , voice your subject characteristics .
rats can fix the upper part of his body when trying to remember their history , they can put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , or change its position in a certain way to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complicated issues behind us .
привирающие people can also use disengagement in the speech : " i have n't had sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky " or repeat a complicated question entirely . ...
someone can use the " qualification " language , when answering a question : " well ... the truth ... as far as i know ... as far as i know . "
there is no magical means to detect lies , but to master the skill can detect deception .

he explained that on saturday will be held антропометрические measuring all participants ( height , weight and waist girth ) , measuring blood pressure and glucose levels , and fat , cholesterol and insulin and genetic analysis ( in order to identify genes that are associated with childhood obesity ) .
in medical research , conducted in the period from 1999 to 2006 , says that there was just 6 years growth : in the case of boys 77 percent were obese , in the case of girls 47 % ; when it comes to weight , there is also experienced significant growth , " said specialist mssi .

рафаель эррера , a researcher at the chemical faculty unam , has developed a polymer - bitumen , modified to produce a mixture of the best quality , sustainable to exposure to environmental and temperature .
in his lectures technological view of the pits , read within the international year of chemistry , reported that laboratory , for which he is responsible , is developing polymer - modified bitumen for mixed with characteristics close to the bitumen production , but with the best opposition , both with high and at low temperatures .
he explained that the bitumen , the most difficult part of the oil is a sequence of molecules of hydrocarbons , some high - molecular weight , called асфальтенами and other low - molecular weight - so - called мальтенами , which together give the road to cover his typical вязкоупругое demeanor .
this means that the resistance street asphalt is not constant , and changes throughout the day , depending on the natural conditions and temperature , said an expert in the area of chemical engineering .
among most of the upper layers is bitumen , made of small stones , опущенных in bitumen and then спрессованных .
when movement of vehicles and latch efforts , it helps to forces very well be on the road to cover .
on the асфальтовом cover , he added , put the last layer , called a layer of wear and tear , which is made out of the small stone , in fact sand also immersed in the asphalt .
as part of pavement , which will be to receive and distribute these efforts , layer wear also requires the proper thickness , and it is necessary to take account of the material , from which he is .
when the earth crude , water seeps into the body coverage and finds it difficult to go from there , and it causes размягчение all sectors of the cover , and therefore education yam .
also a member of the national researchers explained that the transport system load - this is another important factor in the formation of holes , and therefore the thickness of each layer coating should always be connected to transport load and need to ensure this requirement , to prevent the frequent appearance of yam .
what lacked the candidate from the valle , order to become the new miss colombia , ? "
on this time мелина ramirez serna was supposed to be contented with what was on the podium winners with a silver crown and ribbon proclaiming her new princess in colombia .

between the magazine , a journalist _guido ойос кромос believes that the mistake females valle de cauca was that she has undergone major surgery .
her body was never her advantage , and here , she had was punished for it .

both sides see the immigration burden for french society and the for the french economy .
in its programme in francois hollande was confined to platitudes , saying " joint work will solve our immigration problem . "
as ian goldin and jeffrey cameron reminds us economists in a recent book , обобщившей recent data about immigration ( special people : how migration shaped our world and will determine our future , may 2011 , at princeton university , with 352 . ) , there is broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows in economic growth , employment and wages in countries that accept immigrants .
fears for the influence of immigrants are based on the view that they are able to replace local workers , especially low - skilled , provoking decrease wages .

all of europe entirely subject to dictates of markets and rating agencies , suffers from their weakness and from the lack of solidarity .
many worry about the transfer of sovereignty , europe , but the entire europe gradually loses its sovereignty , and each of its nations along with her .
because only joint work of europeans will be able to reduce the severity of the debt each , free from markets and prepare for the future , by investing in him .
after a long discussion of this proposal the socialists and jacques delors now require all european economic government .
but to represent her without a stronger economic integration , political and democratic , maturing in life граздан , is another madness and a new impasse .
to install the republic of in france , was necessary to " create " republicans .
